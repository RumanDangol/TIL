==================Gradle=========================
-> is an open source, advanced build management system
-> build on ANT, Maven, and Ivy repositories.
-> supports Groovy based Domain Specific Language (DSL)

--------History of gradle-----------
First ant was used but ant uses xml format to write build scripts
XML is hiearchical so it became unmanageably big

So Maven was used, it changed its structure but uses XML to write build scripts
Benefit of Maven is its life cycle, uses same life cycle for multiple projects
Doesnot handle well conflicts between versions of same library and
Complex customized build scripts are hardeer
--------------------------------------------

------------- Gradle was introduced in 2012 ---------------
#Features :

-> declarative builds and build-by-convention 
-> language for dependency based programming
-> Structure your build
-> Deep API
-> Gradle scales
-> Multi-project builds
-> Different ways to manage your builds
-> First build integration tool
-> Ease of migration
-> Gradle Wrapper (allows to execute Gradle builds where Gradle is not installed, useful for continuous integration of servers)
-> Groovy(written in Groovy because similar to Java, and build should be as trasparent as possible to all team members)
 
-----------------------------------------------------

----------- Installation of Gradle in Linux ----------------------
-> Should have jdk installed greater than version 6
-> Download Gradle file
-> extract files in opt/gradle
Now setting path in terminal 
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gradle/gradle(-4.5.1)/bin // -4.5.1 can be changed to the versions of gradle

gradle -v in terminal shows version of gradle
